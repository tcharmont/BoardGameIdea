mechanics = {
    "Acting": "Games with the Acting mechanic require players to use some form of mime or mimicry to communicate with "
              "the other players.",
    "Action Drafting": "Players select from an assortment of Actions in a shared pool. The available Actions are "
                       "limited in quantity, and once a player has chosen an Action it may not be chosen again. ",
    "Action Points": "A player receives a number of Action Points on their turn. They may spend them on a variety of "
                     "Actions.",
    "Action Queue": "Players create Action Queues and perform them in sequence. Queues can either be \"Batch\" "
                    "queues, where all actions are executed in sequence, or \"Rolling\" queues where actions are "
                    "added to the end of the Queue, and the first action is then executed.",
    "Action Retrieval": "Each player has a set of Actions available to them, embodied in cards, tokens, or some other "
                        "affordance. Once performed, they are spent and may not be performed again until retrieved. "
                        "Action Retrieval typically is itself an Action, or may take an entire turn.",
    "Tile Placement": "Tile Placement games feature placing a piece to score VPs or trigger abilities, often based on "
                      "adjacent pieces or pieces in the same group/cluster, and keying off non-spatial properties "
                      "like color, \"feature completion\", cluster size etc.",
    "Rock-Paper-Scissors": "There are three possible options, and they are cyclically superior (A beats B, B beats C, "
                           "and C beats A).",
    "Set Collection": "The primary goal of a set collection mechanism is to encourage a player to collect a set of "
                      "items. For example, players collect and harvest different types of beans in Bohnanza, "
                      "and they collect Monuments in Ra.",
    "Stock Holding": "Stock holding is a subcategory of Commodity Speculation, in which instead of purchasing or "
                     "selling an entire commodity, players purchase and sell (or hold) a share in a given company, "
                     "commodity or nation.",
    "Pick-up and Deliver": 'This mechanism usually requires players to pick up an item or good at one location on the '
                           'playing board and bring it to another location on the playing board. Initial placement of '
                           'the item can be either predetermined or random. The delivery of the good usually gives '
                           'the player money to do more actions with. In most cases, there is a game rule or another '
                           'mechanic that determines where the item needs to go.',
    "Trading": "Players may Trade assets with each other.",
    "Trick-taking": "Players play cards from their hand to the table in a series of rounds, or “tricks” which are "
                    "each evaluated separately to determine a winner and to apply other potential effects. The most "
                    "common way to win a trick is by having the card with highest value of the suit that was led, "
                    "but many classical card games use the \"trump\" system (where the certain cards, usually those "
                    "of a designated suit, will win the trick if they are played.) Occasionally there is a round of "
                    "bidding to determine this trump suit. In many trick taking games (though not all), players are "
                    "required to \"follow suit\", i.e. play a card of the same suit as was led if they have one. If "
                    "they do not have a matching card, they must play another card from their hand.",
    "Crayon Rail System": "The Crayon Rail System is a subcategory of Route/Network Building. Types of these games "
                          "use crayon or other non-permanent methods of making connecting lines on a board, "
                          "often eraseable.  The most popular Crayon Rail games are part of the Empire Builder "
                          "system.",
    "Modular Board": "Play occurs upon a modular board that is composed of multiple pieces, often tiles or cards. In "
                     "many games, board placement is randomized, leading to different possibilities for strategy and "
                     "exploration. Some games in this category have multiple boards which are not used "
                     "simultaneously, preserving table space. Unused boards remain out of play until they are "
                     "required.",
    "Auction/Bidding": "This mechanic requires you to place a bid, usually monetary, on items in an auction of goods "
                       "in order to enhance your position in the game. These goods allow players future actions or "
                       "improve a position. The auction consists of taking turns placing bids on a given item until "
                       "one winner is established, allowing the winner to take control of the item being bid on. "
                       "Usually there is a game rule that helps drop the price of the items being bid on if no "
                       "players are interested in the item at its current price. In most games, once a winner for one "
                       "item is done, if there are more items to be bid upon, another auction is held for those "
                       "items. The process repeats until a game condition is met or items are exhausted in the "
                       "auction phase of the game. This is similar to Worker Placement, but workers can be kicked off "
                       "spots by bidding higher.",
    "Commodity Speculation": "Commodity Speculation is a subcategory of Betting and Bluffing, in which in-game money "
                             "is bet on different commodities in hope that that particular commodity will become the "
                             "most valuable as the game progresses. Often the values of the commodities are "
                             "continually changing throughout the game, and the players buy and sell the commodities "
                             "to make money off of their investment.",
    "Betting and Bluffing": "Players commit a stake of currency or resources to purchase a chance of winning "
                            "everyone&rsquo;s stake, based on some random outcome like being dealt a superior set "
                            "of cards or rolling a higher number. Players typically have partial information about "
                            "the overall game state, and may \"bluff,\" by representing through "
                            "their in-game actions that they hold a stronger position than they do. Conversely, "
                            "players may \"fold,\" or quit the contest, and limit their losses to "
                            "whatever they had already staked.",
    "Variable Player Powers": "Each player has special Actions that only they can perform, or that modify standard "
                              "actions.",
    "Secret Unit Deployment": "Secret unit deployment games are games that contain hidden information. Only the "
                              "player controlling certain playing pieces has perfect information about the nature (or "
                              "even the whereabouts) of those pieces. This mechanic is often used in wargames to "
                              "simulate \'fog of war\'.",
    "Voting": "Players vote on whether a proposed action will occur or not. In most games with this mechanism each "
              "player has one vote. However several, like Junta, give players different numbers of votes depending on "
              "their board position or the issue being voted on.",
    "Campaign / Battle Card Driven": "The Campaign/Battle Card Driven mechanic is a relatively recent development in "
                                     "wargames that focuses the players' actions on cards they have in their hand. "
                                     "The very basic idea is that performing a single action uses a single card. "
                                     "Games where cards are used to determine the outcome of battles do not use this "
                                     "mechanic.",
    "Team-Based Game": "In team-based games, teams of players compete with one another to obtain victory. There are a "
                       "variety of possible team structures, including symmetrical teams like 2v2 and 3v3, "
                       "multiple sides like 2v2v2, and even One vs. All.",
    "Simultaneous Action Selection": "Players plan their turn simultaneously and secretly. Then, they reveal their "
                                     "plans at the same time.",
    "Area-Impulse": "Players subdivide turns into impulses alternating between players which repeat until both "
                    "players pass (or in some cases a sunset die roll ends the impulses catching one or both players "
                    "off guard). In those impulses a group of units is once activated or gets to act collectively "
                    "before being marked spent. However instead of the activated units being grouped by a certain "
                    "radius from a leader the units activated are in an area (and thus the need for the impulse "
                    "system to have areas, not hexes). The areas exist to define scope of activation on an impulse ("
                    "as well as restrict what can be done on that impulse with respect to attack and movement range). "
                    "Thus each of a players groups of units each acts once by means of small alternating impulses "
                    "instead of the traditional all my units then all your units. Finally before the next turn of "
                    "impulses spent units are reset regaining the ability to act.",
    "Cooperative Game": "Players coordinate their actions to achieve a common win condition or conditions. Players "
                        "all win or lose the game together.",
    "Hexagon Grid": "Pieces are placed on a board tessellated with hexagons, which is used for adjacency and/or "
                    "movement.",
    "Storytelling": "In storytelling games, players are provided with conceptual, written, or pictorial stimuli which "
                    "must be incorporated into a story of the players' creation. Once Upon a Time uses a selection of "
                    "words while Rory's Story Cubes include ambiguous symbols. Some games like Snake Oil and Big Idea "
                    "prompt players to pitch a product, which frequently takes the form of a brief story or vignette.",
    "Role Playing": "Some board games incorporate elements of role playing. It can be that players control a "
                    "character that improves over time. It can also be a game that encourages or inspires "
                    "Storytelling. This mechanic can be viewed as an extension of Variable Player Powers.",
    "Roll / Spin and Move": "Roll / Spin and move games are games where players roll dice or spin spinners and move "
                            "playing pieces in accordance with the roll.",
    "Singing": "Games that use a Singing mechanic require players to hum or sing familiar songs in order to fulfill "
               "certain game requirements.",
    "Line Drawing": "Games using the line drawing mechanic involve the drawing of lines in one way or another. Lines "
                    "may be used to connect objects as in Sprouts, to isolate objects, or to create areas as in the "
                    "classic Dots and Dashes, also known as Square-it.",
    "Hand Management": "Hand management games are games with cards in them that reward players for playing the cards "
                       "in certain sequences or groups. The optimal sequence/grouping may vary, depending on board "
                       "position, cards held and cards played by opponents. Managing your hand means gaining the most "
                       "value out of available cards under given circumstances. Cards often have multiple uses in the "
                       "game, further obfuscating an \"optimal\" sequence.",
    "Card Drafting": "Card drafting games are games in which players pick cards from a limited subset, such as a "
                     "common pool, to gain some advantage (immediate or longterm) or to assemble hands of cards that "
                     "are used to meet objectives within the game. Saint Petersburg is a well-known card drafting "
                     "game.",
    "Enclosure": "In Area Enclosure games, players place or move pieces in order to surround as much area as possible "
                 "with their pieces. The oldest and most famous Area Enclosure game is of course Go, but many newer "
                 "examples also exist. Area Enclosure is different than Area Majority / Influence because players "
                 "actually create the areas on a gridded board during the course of play, whereas in Area Majority / "
                 "Influence the actual areas are pre-existing and players are merely battling to see who can control "
                 "the most of them.",
    "Area Movement": "The game board is divided into irregular areas to determine adjacency and movement.",
    "Memory": "Hidden, trackable information whose tracking gives players an advantage.",
    "Pattern Building": "Pattern Building is a system where players place game components in specific patterns in "
                        "order to gain specific or variable game results.  For example: placing chips on 2, 4, 6, "
                        "8 on a board gets the player an action card they can use later in the game.",
    "Paper-and-Pencil": "The game is developed using paper and pen to mark and save responses or attributes that, "
                        "at the end of the game, are used to score points and determine the winner. A game that "
                        "merely keeps track of score on a sheet of paper does not use a paper-and-pencil mechanism.",
    "Chit-Pull System": "Used in wargames to address the problem of simulating simultaneous action on the battlefield "
                        "and issues of \"Command and Control\". In such a system the current player randomly draws a "
                        "chit or counter identifying a group of units which may now be moved. Schemes include moving "
                        "any units commanded by a particular leader, moving units of a particular quality or "
                        "activating units not for movement but for fighting.",
    "Pattern Recognition": "Markers, usually with a color or pattern, are placed or added on different random or "
                           "pre-determined locations relative to a board or the markers themselves. As the markers "
                           "move during play the player has to recognize a known pattern created by the markers to "
                           "gain a good, points or win the game.",
    "Simulation": "Simulation games are games that attempt to model actual events or situations.",
    "Dice Rolling": "A game mechanism dice rolling in a game can be used for many things, randomness being the most "
                    "obvious. Dice can also be used as counters; start at 6 (for a normal die: singular for dice) and "
                    "turn it to 5 at the end of a round, single player's turn etc. The dice themselves can be unique "
                    "and different sizes, shapes and colors to represent different things. In wargames, dice are used "
                    "in conjunction with a variety of tables, notably a \"Combat Results Table\" which produces a "
                    "result by strengths of both sides (either as a ratio or a differential) and a die roll (1D6, "
                    "2D6, and 1D10 are most commonly used).",
    "Point to Point Movement": "On a board of a game with point-to-point movement, there are certain spots that can "
                               "be occupied by markers or figurines, e. g. cities on a map. These points are "
                               "connected by lines, and movement can only happen along these lines. It is not enough "
                               "that two points are next to or close to each other; if there is no connecting line "
                               "between them, a player cannot move his or her piece from one to the other.",
    "Variable Phase Order": "Variable Phase Order implies that turns may not be played the same way as before and / "
                            "or after. Using Puerto Rico as an example, every turn is different. Depending on who "
                            "starts selecting the roles and what roles they take, you may have to play the 'build' "
                            "action sooner than you'd wish. In other games, you may be denied from taking certain "
                            "action. Most games with limited action and any game without a static game turn order "
                            "fall under this 'mechanism'. Use of variable player turn order are not Variable Phase "
                            "Order games.",
    "Area Majority / Influence": "Multiple players may occupy a space and gain benefits based on their proportional "
                                 "presence in the space.",
    "Network and Route Building": "Network Building is a specialized kind of set collection in which the sets "
                                  "collected represent ties between nodes, often represented as routes between "
                                  "destinations.",
    "Worker Placement": "More precisely referred to as \"action drafting\", this mechanism requires players to select "
                        "individual actions from a set of actions available to all players. Players generally select "
                        "actions one-at-a-time and in turn order. There is usually(*) a limit on the number of times "
                        "a single action may be taken. Once that limit for an action is reached, it typically either "
                        "becomes more expensive to take again or can no longer be taken for the remainder of the "
                        "round. As such, not all actions can be taken by all players in a given round, and action "
                        "\"blocking\" occurs. If the game is structured in rounds, then all actions are usually "

    "Push Your Luck": "Players must decide between settling for existing gains, or risking them all for further "
                      "rewards. Push-Your-Luck is also known as press-your-luck.",
    "Time Track": "There is a linear “Time Track” with many spaces. Each player has a marker on the track, "
                  "which indicates where they are “in time.” Markers farther on the track are further forward in "
                  "time. The player with the marker lowest on the track (furthest “back in time”) takes the next "
                  "action. Each action has a cost in time, and the player’s marker is advanced a number of spaces "
                  "according to that cost. Then, the next lowest marker on the track takes an action. It is possible "
                  "that the same player takes multiple turns in a row.",
    "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building": "Players play cards out of individual decks, seeking to acquire new cards and to "
                                    "play through their decks iteratively, improving them over time through card "
                                    "acquisition.",
    "Grid Movement": "Grid Movement occurs when pawns move on the grid in many directions. The grid may be square ("
                     "like in Chess) or hexagonal (as in Abalone). In a game there can be many pawns (like in Chess "
                     "or Checkers) or only one (like the bishop in Fresco).",
    "Player Elimination": "A player can be removed from the game, no longer participating. In some such games, "
                          "all of an eliminated player's material is removed from the game as well; in other such "
                          "games this material may remain in play as neutral material. (E.g. an eliminated player's "

    "Auction: Dutch Priority": "A Dutch Priority Auction is a multiple-lot auction in which prices for the lots are "
                               "determined based on the number of bids placed on the lots up for bid. The winning "
                               "bidder is the first player, in bid priority, who chooses to pay the current price for "
                               "a lot, which is equal to the number of bidding tokens there. Priority may be "
                               "determined by a variety of factors, including global turn order or turn order for "
                               "each lot based on order of bid placement. Players may typically pass on the purchase "
                               "when they are the priority bidder by removing their bidding token. This has the "

    "Pattern Movement": "Pieces move in a specific pattern relative to the board grid.",
    "Movement Points": "A piece is given a number of points to spend on movement. This is common in a variety of "
                       "games, but particularly war games, where spaces can cost different amounts depending on the "
                       "terrain.",

    "Programmed Movement": "Players simultaneously program their movement, and then reveal and execute it. This "
                           "mechanism tends to promote chaos in a game, and benefits those with good spatial "
                           "relations. This is a specialized form of the Action Queue mechanism.",
    "Relative Movement": "The precise location of units is not tracked. Only their Relative Position is important.",
    "Mancala": "In a typical Mancala mechanism, players pick up the tokens in one space, and then place them "
               "one-by-one in spaces in a specific direction around a circle, with the last space placed in having "
               "special significance.",
    "Chaining": 'Pieces are stationary but are built out in chains. This can give a dynamic sense of motion to the '
                'game, even though the pieces do not move.',
    "Bias": "Pieces automatically move in a certain direction, or it is easier to move in a certain direction. This "
            "is commonly used to simulate wind (Yacht Race), currents (Primordial Soup), gravity (Demon's Run), "

    "Pieces as Map": "The Pieces themselves compose the Map.",
    "Multiple Maps": "The game takes place on Multiple Maps which are connected at defined points.",
    "Hidden Movement": "Movement occurs that is not visible to all players. A key challenge for designers is "
                       "determining how to make the movement rules simple enough that the players moving hidden units "
                       "do not make mistakes, or that paths are traceable when the game concludes.",
    "Zone of Control": "Spaces adjacent to a unit impact the ability of opposing units to move or attack.",
    "Line of Sight": "Units may only see certain areas. Mechanically this can be dealt with in a variety of ways, "

                     "color-coded regions showing what can be see what, as in Tannhäuser.",
    "Grid Coverage": "A family of mechanisms in which players cover a grid or fill a space using a variety of shapes.",
    "Ladder Climbing": "Players play one card, or a set of related cards. Subsequently, players must play cards of an "
                       "equal or higher value of the same set already played. The last player to successfully play "

    "Melding and Splaying": "A set of cards in a specific relationship to one another that allows them to be played "
                            "to a table or scored is a meld. When laying these cards down, the way the cards splay, "
                            "or overlap one another, may sometimes reveal or conceal certain abilities or attributes.",
    "Drafting": "Drafting is a means of distributing cards or other game elements to players through an ordered "
                "selection process. A typical implementation involves each player being dealt the same number of "
                "cards. Players then select one card to keep, and pass the rest to their left. This continues until "
                "all cards are taken. 7 Wonders implements this type of draft.",
    "Turn Order: Random": "Representatives of play pieces or players are randomized, and one is drawn at a time. That "

    "Hidden Victory Points": "The number of Victory Points held by each player is private information.",
    "Stacking and Balancing": "Players must physically stack and balance pieces.",
    "Physical Removal": "Pieces are removed from a structure, and play is affected by things that fall (as in Ker "
